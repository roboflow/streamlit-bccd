# Streamlit App for Blood Cell Count Dataset

This app allows you to upload an image of blood cells and use an [object detection model](https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection) to detect the white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.


The app might be [found here](https://roboflow.com/streamlit-bccd):

The app will work as is. If you want to build your own model, you'll need your own API key. [Create a Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com) to get your own API key.

This app was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
